 *

 * 1. **Fewer than two aggregates in view ⇒ one flat row.** A row is a comparison; with one stream
 *    there is nothing to compare and the split would only cost height. This is also why filtering
 *    a 106-slice model down to one aggregate collapses the lane back — rows are computed over the
 *    slices actually being drawn, not over the whole descriptor.
 * 2. **An event sits on its slice's aggregate.** With several, the aggregate whose `appliedEvents`
 *    name it wins; with no answer there (a producer that could not resolve the apply set statically
 *    emits none) it falls back to the slice's first aggregate, which is the claim the slice made
 *    first.
 * 3. **A `Message` is on no stream, and neither is an event whose slice names no aggregate.** They
 *    share the trailing unlabelled row. One row, one meaning — "in the stream lane, on no stream" —
 *    rather than two rows that would both be captioned by their absence.
