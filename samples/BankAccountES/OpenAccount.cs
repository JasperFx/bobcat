    // registered.
    //
    // The write is a Storage.StartStream() side effect rather than a call on an injected session:
    // the endpoint stays a pure function of its inputs, and Wolverine appends the stream through the
    // registered event store — Marten or Fisher — inside the same transaction as the response.
    //
    // [Emits] is the Event Model's view of that side effect (wolverine GH-4386): the event rides
    // inside the StartStream object, constructed here in the body, so nothing on the signature
    // says what this slice appends. Without it no source claims OpenAccount emits AccountOpened,
    // the store's Account view has no link back to the slice that starts every stream it folds,
    // and EventModel.feature says so (bobcat#300).
